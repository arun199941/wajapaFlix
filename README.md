Installing the dependences

The dependence should be installed from the node_module folder of the project or better still, delete the folder and use "npm install" on the root folder of the app, after that run "yarn" to be sure all the dependences are installed.

Project
The objective of the project was to build a movies streaming app. We used Netflix as the sample website. Using react and its component we were used.
React Hooks such as useState and useEffect were used extensively. The styling was done using. The API was gotten from https://developers.themoviedb.org/3, and it is hosted on firebase.google.com. 
I ran into issues trying host on gitpages.

Issues
We had plans to work as a team from the on set but due to some circumstances, we worked individual but we keep can check each others branch.
After submission if there is time we'd go over the project. There was an issue trying to host on gitpages so I used firebase.google.com.

Feedbacks.
The deadline for the project was ambiguous, we were not sure when to submit which led to a little lag in the project building. We had use firebase to host the website before seeing the host options for submission. We'd comply better on subsequent projects.
